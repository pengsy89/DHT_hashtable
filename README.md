DHT_hashtable
=============
RESTful distributed hash table

Created a distributed hash table partly deployed into the cloud (Amazon EC2 instances)

Utilized REST for communication among nodes and Jersey to implement JAX/RS

The nodes of the network run as Java programs, using an embedded Grizzly Web server
